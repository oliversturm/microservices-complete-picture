## Agenda

* The new old stuff -- what we never knew was going to be interesting
* Today's state of things -- what we know and what we should know
* The future: where is C# going?

---

## Some thoughts on `dynamic`

* Available since C# 4.0
* Perhaps the least accepted 'big' feature the language has ever seen?
* ASP.NET MVC is quite 'dynamic'
  * ... and so are other libraries dealing with the dynamic world of online data
* Runtime code generation mechanisms -- food for thought

---

## Something we know:<br> C# 6 Feature Set

* Long teased, finally finalized, stripped bare on short notice
* Favorites:
  * Auto-property assignments
  * Expression bodies
  * String interpolation
  * `using static`

---

## Easily missed: C# REPL

* *C# Interactive* introduced in VS 2015 Update 1
* Useful tool, much loved by devs everywhere, now finally for C#
* Scripting supported (.csx files)

---

## What else is happening with Roslyn?

* In my experience, most initial bugs have now been fixed :)
* Commercial and open source projects use it as a parser and for runtime code generation
* Best case: you don’t notice you’re using it

---

## The world out there: Platforms

* You don’t need Windows anymore to develop for .NET
  * Mono, but also .NET Core
* You don’t need Visual Studio anymore to develop C#
  * Visual Studio Code
  * Xamarin
  * Rider

---

## Popular Patterns

* Reactive: Rx.NET
  * Commonly used in many environments, especially JavaScript
  * Centralized, functional and parallel technique to deal with event-driven information flow
* Actors: akka.net -- check out my presentation *Parallelization with Actors in C#*
  * Fault-tolerant, automatically parallel message passing service framework

---

## The (close) future: C# 7

* Visual Studio 2017 RC builds available now
  * Out parameters
  * Pattern matching
  * Tuples
  * Local functions
  * Expression bodies for getters, setters, ctors and finalizers
  * Throw expressions
  * Literals
  * Ref returns and locals
